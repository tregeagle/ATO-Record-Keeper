## Tax Reporting Concerns

### Critical Items to Track
1. **Capital Gains/Losses** - You've had multiple sales; need to calculate cost basis for each sold unit
2. **Brokerage Fees** - Each transaction has transaction costs (recorded in Pearler)
3. **Dividend Income** - ETF distributions not visible in this export; may need separate statement
4. **Cost Basis Determination** - For large liquidations in 2023 and 2025, method matters (FIFO/LIFO/ACB)

### Data Quality Issues
- Sharesight is incomplete for tax purposes (missing ~6 months of early trades)
- Transaction statement shows running balance but not individual lot tracking
- No dividend/distribution information in exports provided

## Recommended Approach for Tax Simplification

### For Going Forward (Manual Reinvestment)
1. **Keep a simple spreadsheet** with:
   - Date of purchase
   - ETF ticker
   - Quantity bought
   - Price per unit
   - Brokerage fee
   - Total cost

2. **Quarterly tracking**:
   - Track dividend distributions received
   - Update cost basis as you buy
   - Keep Pearler statements as backup

3. **Capital gains calculation**:
   - Use Pearler's data for historical sales (they have it recorded)
   - For future sales, document the purchase date of units being sold (FIFO is simplest)

### Next Steps
- ✅ Have Pearler transaction statement (complete)
- ❌ Need: Dividend/distribution history (separate export from Pearler/Sharesight)
- ❌ Need: Confirmation of cost basis method preferred for tax purposes (FIFO/LIFO/ACB)
- ❌ Need: Any other income or investment accounts to factor in

## Questions for Your Accountant

1. Do I have the complete dividend history recorded, or do I need to request that from Pearler?
2. For the 2023 and 2025 liquidations, which cost basis method do you recommend I use?
3. Are there any CGT concessions or considerations for Australian ETF distributions I should know about?
4. Should I be tracking VDHG separately (it was a one-time sale in Feb 2022)?
